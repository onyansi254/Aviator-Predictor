# Aviator Predictor

An experimental application to collect real-time data from the Aviator game, analyze patterns, and attempt to make predictions based on historical trends. This project uses multiple data collection methods (API calls, web scraping, OCR, packet sniffing, etc.) and dynamically switches between them to maintain a reliable data stream. The aim is to detect and analyze patterns to predict potential outcomes in the Aviator game.

## Overview

The Aviator Predictor is designed to continuously collect data from the Aviator game in real-time. It uses various methods to gather data (API, web scraping, OCR, etc.), stores the data in a database, and then analyzes it to identify patterns. The goal is to make short-term predictions based on detected patterns, though this project remains experimental.

**DISCLAIMER**: This project is for educational and experimental purposes only. Use of this app or its code is at your own risk, and no guarantees are provided about the accuracy of predictions.

## Features

- **Multiple Data Collection Methods**: Collects data via API, web scraping, OCR, and packet sniffing, and dynamically switches methods if one fails.
- **Real-Time Data Storage**: Stores collected data in a SQLite database for easy access and retrieval.
- **Pattern Analysis**: Analyzes historical data to identify potential trends.
- **Prediction Engine**: Uses simple trend-based predictions, which can be expanded with machine learning models.
- **Monitoring & Fallback Mechanism**: Automatically switches data collection methods if a failure is detected, ensuring continuous operation.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aviator-predictor.git
   cd aviator-predictor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add the required environment variables. For example:
   ```plaintext
   DB_NAME=aviator_data.db
   DB_USER=your_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

---

## Usage

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

2. **Data Collection**:
   The `method_selector.py` in the `data_collection` folder will automatically choose the best method to collect data. If one method fails, it will switch to an alternate method.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   Patterns are analyzed based on historical data, and predictions are made based on the most recent patterns detected.

4. **View Data and Predictions**:
   Use the `Database` class (located in `data_storage/database.py`) to view collected data and pattern analysis results.

## Configuration

All configurations (API keys, database settings, etc.) should be stored in the `.env` file to keep sensitive information secure. The `utils/config.py` file reads and applies these configurations to the application.

---

## Data Collection Methods

This application supports multiple data collection methods:
- **API Collector** (`api_collector.py`): Connects to available APIs (if any) to fetch data directly.
- **Web Scraper** (`scraper_collector.py`): Scrapes data from the Aviator web interface.
- **Browser Extension Collector** (`extension_collector.py`): Uses a browser extension to capture data in real time.
- **OCR Collector** (`ocr_collector.py`): Uses OCR to extract data from screenshots if other methods fail.
- **Packet Sniffer** (`packet_sniffer.py`): Captures data directly from network packets, useful for detecting patterns without direct access to an API.

Each method is implemented with an `is_available` function to check if it’s currently operational. The `method_selector.py` file dynamically switches between methods when failures occur.

---

## Pattern Analysis and Prediction

The `PatternAnalyzer` class in `pattern_analyzer.py` is responsible for analyzing trends in the collected data. This analysis can use simple statistical models or be expanded to include machine learning models for more sophisticated predictions.

### Example of Pattern Analysis:

- **Moving Average**: The application computes moving averages of crash multipliers to detect possible trends.
- **Trend Detection**: Recognizes high and low points to detect cycles.
