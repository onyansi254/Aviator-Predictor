## Features

- Collect data from APIs, web scraping, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
- Analyze patterns in the collected data to make predictions.
- Utilize packet sniffing for advanced data collection (use with caution).
- Logging functionality for tracking application behavior and errors.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/onyansi254/aviator-predictor.git
   cd aviator-predictor
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Configure the application**: Update any necessary configuration settings in the code (e.g., API endpoints, URLs for web scraping, image paths for OCR).

2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

3. **Collect data**: The application will collect data based on the configured methods, analyze patterns, and output predictions.

## Data Collection Methods

The application implements the following data collection methods:

- **API Collector**: Collects data from predefined APIs.
- **Web Scraping**: Scrapes data from specified URLs using BeautifulSoup.
- **OCR Collector**: Uses Tesseract to extract text from images of game screens.
- **Packet Sniffer**: Captures live network packets (requires appropriate permissions).
